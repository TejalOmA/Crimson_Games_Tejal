# Player Activity Analysis 🎮  

In this project, I have used MongoDB to analyze player activity data for a mobile game 🕹️ , focusing on player retention across two consecutive days: November 13th and 14th, 2024. 📊 

### Steps 🛠️ 

1. **Connect to MongoDB** to store and manage the data.  
2. Inserting sample player activity data. 
3. Queried the database to find:  
   - Players who logged in on November 13th.  
   - Players who logged in on both November 13th and 14th.  
4. Calculated the percentage of players who returned the next day with the above data.

### Results ✅
